# URDF Structure with Links and Joints

## Example Humanoid Structure
- base_link (root)
  - torso
    - head
    - left_arm
      - left_forearm
        - left_hand
    - right_arm
      - right_forearm
        - right_hand
    - left_leg
      - left_foot
    - right_leg
      - right_foot

## Components
- Links: Rigid bodies (represented as boxes)
- Joints: Connections allowing motion (represented as circles)
- Hierarchy: Parent-child relationships defining kinematic chain
