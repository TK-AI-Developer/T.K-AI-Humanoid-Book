# Biological Nervous System vs ROS 2 Architecture

## Biological Nervous System
Sensory Organs -> Spinal Cord -> Brain -> Motor Neurons -> Muscles

## ROS 2 Architecture
Sensors -> Topics -> Processing Nodes -> Service Calls -> Actuators

## Key Similarities
- Distributed processing
- Communication via signals/messages
- Coordination between components
- Feedback loops for control
