# Module 3: Simulation & Perception

Welcome to Module 3 of the AI-Robotics course, where we'll explore simulation environments and perception systems for humanoid robots. This module focuses on creating photorealistic simulation environments using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, implementing perception systems with VSLAM and sensor fusion, and developing path planning algorithms for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Isaac Sim environments
- Create photorealistic simulation scenarios
- Generate synthetic data for AI training
- Deploy humanoid robots in simulation environments
- Implement perception systems with VSLAM and sensor fusion
- Develop path planning algorithms for bipedal humanoid robots

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following chapters:

1. [Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data](./isaac-sim-synthetic-data.md) - Setting up photorealistic simulation environments and generating synthetic data for AI training
2. [Perception Systems](./perception-systems.md) - Implementing VSLAM, sensor fusion, and navigation pipeline
3. [Path Planning](./path-planning.md) - Developing algorithms for bipedal movement, obstacle avoidance, and trajectory planning

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Understanding of simulation environments (covered in Module 2)

## Getting Started

Begin with the first chapter on Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data to learn how to set up and configure photorealistic simulation environments for humanoid robots.
