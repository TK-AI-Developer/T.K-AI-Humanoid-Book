# Introduction to AI-Robot Brain & Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to the educational modules for AI-Robot Brain & Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robotics. This book covers advanced topics in simulation, perception, navigation, and voice-driven autonomous actions across four comprehensive modules.

## Modules Overview

This book is organized into four progressive modules:

- **Module 1: Introduction to AI-Robotics** - Foundations of robotics, ROS 2 as the nervous system, Python agents, URDF models, and core concepts like nodes, topics, and services.

- **Module 2: Simulation & Physics** - Unity rendering for realistic visualization, Gazebo physics simulation, and sensor integration for accurate environmental modeling.

- **Module 3: Simulation & Perception** - Focuses on creating photorealistic simulation environments, implementing perception systems with VSLAM and sensor fusion, and developing path planning algorithms for humanoid robots.

- **Module 4: Planning & Integration** - Covers voice-to-action conversion, cognitive planning for mapping natural language to robot actions, and the integration of all systems in a capstone autonomous humanoid project.

## Target Audience

This material is designed for AI & Robotics students with simulation experience who want to learn about advanced robotics concepts using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, ROS 2, and Python.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing these modules, you will be able to:
- Understand foundational robotics concepts and ROS 2 architecture
- Create realistic simulation environments with proper physics and rendering
- Set up and run photorealistic AI training scenarios in simulation
- Implement navigation and path planning for humanoid robots
- Convert voice commands to executable robot actions
- Integrate perception, planning, and manipulation systems in simulation
