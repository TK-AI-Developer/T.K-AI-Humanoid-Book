# Glossary: ROS 2 as the Nervous System of Humanoid Robots

## A

**Action**: A communication pattern in ROS 2 for long-running tasks with feedback, similar to services but with status updates.

## J

**Joint**: A connection between two links in a robot that allows relative motion.

## L

**Link**: A rigid component of a robot in URDF (Unified Robot Description Format).

## N

**Node**: An independent computational unit in ROS 2 that performs specific functions and communicates with other nodes.

## R

**ROS (Robot Operating System)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster.

**ROS 2**: The second generation of the Robot Operating System with improved security, real-time capabilities, and support for commercial products.

**rclpy**: The Python client library for ROS 2, providing the interface between Python programs and the ROS 2 middleware.

## S

**Service**: A communication pattern in ROS 2 for request-response interactions with guaranteed delivery.

## T

**Topic**: A communication pattern in ROS 2 for publish-subscribe messaging with best-effort delivery.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML-based format that describes robot kinematic and visual properties.
