# Module 4: Planning & Integration

Welcome to Module 4 of the AI-Robotics course, where we'll explore cognitive planning and the integration of all systems for voice-driven autonomous actions. This module covers voice-to-action conversion, cognitive planning for mapping natural language to robot actions, and the integration of perception, planning, and manipulation systems in a capstone autonomous humanoid project.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Process voice commands and convert them to executable actions
- Implement cognitive planning systems that map natural language to robot actions
- Integrate perception, planning, and manipulation systems
- Execute complex tasks using voice commands in simulation
- Build a complete autonomous humanoid system

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following chapters:

1. [Voice-to-Action](./voice-to-action.md) - Converting voice commands to executable robot actions
2. [Cognitive Planning](./cognitive-planning.md) - Mapping natural language to action sequences
3. [Capstone Autonomous Humanoid](./capstone-autonomous-humanoid.md) - Integrating perception, planning, navigation, and manipulation in simulation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Understanding of robotics concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Knowledge of simulation and perception (covered in Modules 2 and 3)
- Familiarity with navigation systems (covered in Module 3)

## Getting Started

Begin with the first chapter on Voice-to-Action to learn how to process voice commands and convert them to executable robot actions.
